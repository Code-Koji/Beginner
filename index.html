          <p class="WEBS"><span class="INFO">The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed through the internet. </span> It was created by <span class="SIR">Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and became publicly available in 1991.</span> The web uses a global network infrastructure to connect computers worldwide, allowing users to access and navigate through a vast amount of web pages, websites, and online resources.<br><br>

The World Wide Web operates on the basis of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which enables the retrieval and display of linked documents, commonly referred to as web pages, using a web browser. It also relies on other technologies such as HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript to structure and enhance the content of web pages.<br><br><br>

The web has revolutionized the way people access and share information, allowing for instant communication, collaboration, e-commerce, and virtually limitless access to knowledge and resources. It has profoundly influenced various fields, including education, entertainment, business, research, and social interactions.</p>
